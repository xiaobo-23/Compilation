# Compilation.jl
Compilation.jl is a high-performance tensor network framework for preparing the ground-state or short-time evolved state of the Kitaev honeycomb model and its generalizations on quantum hardware.

Kitaev.jl is actively evolving, with planned extensions including compressing the time-evoltion quantum circuit per step.
